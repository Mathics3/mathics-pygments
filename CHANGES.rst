CHANGES
=======

1.0.0
-----

First public release. Is largely the same thing as
pygments-mathematica, but we are geared for CLI use in mathicsscript and
we get operator information from Mathics Scanner.

For uses outside of terminal use, pygments-mathematica is probably better.
But over time I expect this will change since we will draw more power from
Mathics Scanner.
